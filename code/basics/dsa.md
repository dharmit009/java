# DSA: Data Structures & Algorithms

## What are Data Structure?

> A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.

* int, float, double, String : basics data types
* arrays, list, hash map (something like dictionary) : data structures.

Music player
* alone -> faded -> animals -> ping pong -> Loop back (Circular linked list)
* ticket window line wise ...
* images


Dictionary: stores in key value pair
* attract: "affection"

| words   | it's meaning |
|---------|--------------|
| key     | value        |
| attract | "affection"  |
| 1       | "one"        |
| 2       | "two"        |
| 0       | "zero"       |

## Algorithms:

> An algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to
> solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation
